### What we can not do with python ?
Python is a powerful language, but there are some things it’s not the best at:

* **Mobile App Development –** Python is not commonly used for making mobile apps because it’s slow compared to others.
* **High-Performance Gaming –** Python is not ideal for games that need super-fast graphics and performance.
* **Operating Systems –** OS kernels (like Windows or Linux) are built with C/C++ because Python is slower and not low-level enough.
* **Real-Time Systems –** Python is not great for applications that need real-time speed, like autopilot systems in airplanes.
* **Memory-Intensive Tasks –** Python uses more memory compared to C or Rust, making it less suitable for tasks that need strict memory control.

**Note : That said, Python is great for automation, AI, web apps, and much more!**


## Features of Python :
Python has many cool features that make it popular! Here are some in simple features :

* `Easy to Learn` – Python looks like English, so it's simple to read and write.
* `Free & Open Source` – You can download, use, and even change Python for free!
* `Platform Independent` - Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux.
* `Dynamically Typed` – You don’t need to declare variable types (e.g., x = 5 just works).
* `Interpreted` – No need to compile; just run the code directly.
* `Multi-Purpose` – Used for web development, data science, AI, automation, and more!
* `Extensible & Embeddable` – You can combine it with C, C++, or Java for more power.
* `Huge Library Support` – It has ready-made tools for almost everything—web, AI, automation, etc.
* `Object-Oriented & Functional` – You can write code using objects or simple functions.
