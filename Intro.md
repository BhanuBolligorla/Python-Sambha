### What we can not do with python ?
Python is a powerful language, but there are some things it’s not the best at:

* **Mobile App Development –** Python is not commonly used for making mobile apps because it’s slow compared to others.
* **High-Performance Gaming –** Python is not ideal for games that need super-fast graphics and performance.
* **Operating Systems –** OS kernels (like Windows or Linux) are built with C/C++ because Python is slower and not low-level enough.
* **Real-Time Systems –** Python is not great for applications that need real-time speed, like autopilot systems in airplanes.
* **Memory-Intensive Tasks –** Python uses more memory compared to C or Rust, making it less suitable for tasks that need strict memory control.

**Note : That said, Python is great for automation, AI, web apps, and much more!**
